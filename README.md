## Merry Christmas Emilia!

I love you so much so I bought you a EURail ticket to go on European adventures with me

Here's a [link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eurail-interrail-rail-planner/id579547877) to the Rail Planner App so you can store your mobile ticket

Your pass number is **7817QW** and I said your name was _Emilia Dick Fiora_ (sadly del Fabro wouldn't fit) so use that as your last name

Don't activate your pass just yet! I think we have to do it right before we start travelling so hold your horses and just add your pass for now

I got 4 travel days in a one month period, so that should be enough for us to go from Copenhagen to Paris, Paris to Switzerland, and then I can use it to get back to Copenhagen. That also means we can add in a stop in Germany if we want and you should still have an extra day at the end

I hope you like your practical experience based present. I love you dearly darling and I'm so excited to have so many adventures with you




P.s. Also come on, am I a coding god or what? Just look at this technical wizardry (and if it failed, you'll never see it, so there)
